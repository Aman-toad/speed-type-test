# Speed Typing App

## Overview
The Speed Typing App is a web-based project that helps users test and improve their typing speed and accuracy. It generates random text for the user to type, tracks the typing duration, and calculates the words per minute (WPM) along with accuracy.

## Features
- **Random Text Generation:** A new random passage is displayed each time the page is refreshed.
- **Timer:** Starts automatically when the user begins typing and stops once the text matches.
- **Typing Accuracy Calculation:** Compares typed text with the displayed text word by word.
- **Words Per Minute (WPM) Calculation:** Calculates typing speed based on the number of characters typed.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
